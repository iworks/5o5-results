<h1 align="center">The Typical 505 Sailor</h1>
Updated 22 August, 1999
<p>
There is no such thing as a typical 505 sailor.  There are pre-teens to people in their 70s actively racing the 505;  Current intercollegiate sailors to relaxed retired couples; people who have been sailing and racing for 50+ years, and those who are just learning how to sail and race; people racing 505s during their Olympic Trials campaign, to people who do only one or two regattas a year, to people who do not race, but enjoy high performance day sailing.  There are people under five foot tall and there are people close to seven feet tall, there are people weighing under 100 pounds and people weighing over 250 pounds. There are Olympic medalists and people who have never won a race in any boat.
<p>
If you want to daysail with your spouse, 3 kids, and the dog, perhaps the 505 is not for you. On the other hand, if you can sail a Laser, you can sail a 505 - and go MUCH faster!
<p>
You could be a "typical" 505 sailor.
<p>
To give a sense of what 505 sailors are like, here are some "representative" 505 sailors.

Peter is one of the great crews, racing in multiple classes.  He does everything except steer; he judges sail trim by how the boat feels from the wire, and calls tactics.  Some of his skippers have reported that the skipper is not allowed to look around, only to check the leech tension from time to time.  
<p>
Peter won the '93, '94 and the '97 North American Championships (with two different skippers), and was second in the NAs earlier with yet another different skipper. He won the '96 East Coast Championship and was 2nd twice in the ECC. He has  won the 505 Midwinters 3 times with 3 diferent skippers, and been second 3 more times with 3 other skippers.  Peter was 4th in the 1998 Hyannis 505 World championship, with Mike Zani driving.  
He is also in demand in J24 and Melges 24 - but the 505 is by far his favorite.  Peter also races Vanguard 15 with Kara and team races.  His team, "Pablo Picasso", won the Hinmann Trophy - US Sailing's National Team Racing Championship - in '96.  Peter was V-15 National Champ in 1995, and finished 2nd in both 1993 and 1994. Peter recently swore off lead mines entirely, &quot;I just will not go out racing on a keelboat&quot;, are his exact words.  
Peter has been a cabinet maker, and more recently boat building, as a partner in Guck Inc, in Bristol RI.  They are dealers for Rondar and the Rondar 505.<br clear="all">

One of the original builders of the midwest 505 fleet, Graham has been active in the class for over 25 years</a> (Graham raced the famed '71 Santa Cruz World Championship).  One of the most helpful people in the class, he has taught many people how to sail and race 505s. Graham is a professional engineer, and more recently part time boatbuilder.<br clear="all">

Henry started racing in Erie PA, and was a long time Fireball racer - he still has a bare Fireball hull which he may fix up again some day - and is a past Fireball North American and US National Champion.  Henry moved to Hampton VA and got into 505s during the 80s, racing out of Hampton Yacht Club.  He has been 505 Regional  (Chesapeake Bay) Champion twice.  He is much in demand as a J24 and other leadmine helsman or tactician, and has participated in several World Championships in the US, Canada and Australia, in the 505 (preferred), Fireball, Shark 24 and J24, but has cut back to focus on the 505 in recent years.  He also won Key West Race Week Division C as tactician/helmsman, on "Defiance" in 1989.  Henry raced 505s with girlfriend - and later wife - Barb Moss Amthor, but now normally races with his brother Doug.  The Amthor's are renowned for their light and medium air speed, especially downwind.  The stranger seabreeze and tide get, the better they do.  Henry is the Star Wars - the Chesapeake Bay Champion of Champions for 1996, 1997, and 1999 racing with a 505 sailors as crew.  Henry is a construction executive.

<h4><a name="bergstrom">Krister Bergstrom</a></h4>

<i>"Sailing 5o5 is the most exciting thing I know"</i>
<p>
Krister Bergstrom has an impressive list of qualifications in 5o5. He has won the World Championship four times, the European Championship once, the Swedish championship 
11 times, the Scandinavian Championship 3 times, the Golden Anchor once and finally he has been nominated yachtsman of the year by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010306075457/http://www.ssf.se/welcome.htm">Swedish Yachting Association</a>. 
Krister is a long-time member of GKSS, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010306075457/http://www.gkss.se/index-eng.shtml">Royal Gothenburg Yacht Club</a>.
<p>
Born 1956, raised in Gothenburg on the Swedish westcoast, now (February '96) lives in Stockholm with wife Helen and their two children, Oskar and Hanna. Krister has lived here for the last 10 years. He works as a highschool teacher at the Tyreso Gymnasium.
<p>
<h6>A Way of Living</h6>
Krister started to sail the 5o5 in 1974 together with Martin, one of his three younger brothers. Before the 5o5 they had been sailing the Trapez, a racing dinghy designed by Paul Elvstrom, as many others in Sweden and Denmark who joined the 5o5 class at that time did. Krister has since then remained true to the class and is today one of the legends within 5o5 sailing. The next Worlds in Denmark will be his 17th!
<p>
The motive power behind his success is great zeal in sailing, which makes him go sailing time after time.  Today, sailing is not only an interest of his, but it has also become a way of living. He is not only talented and interested in sailing but he also has the physical qualities needed to become a top class yachtsman. He is strong and flexible, has good balance and he quickly apprehends and understands the different situations that occur in races. These qualifications together with a well planned and carried through training have led him and his crew to success.
<p>
His training consists of three different parts - physical, mental and sailing. The physical training is mostly running to get in good conditions and weight lifting for shoulders and backside. The mental training increases his ability to concentrate which helps him to systematically and thoroughly think of the start, the first windward sailing and so on. After a race he analyzes advantages and disadvantages.
<h6>Serious "Here and Now"</h6>
The most important training is of course the hours spent in the boat.  Krister has about 200 hours of efficient sailing practice before he participates in a championship. It is the amount of sailing that separates the top class from the less successful ones. He is of the opinion that the elite are both practicing and competing more than the rest and he emphasizes the 
importance of being serious "here and now" in order to achieve ones goal.
<p>
But how is he able to make the boat go at such great speed?
<p>
- Training, training and again training he replies. You have to manoeuvre the boat and sheet the sails right and at the same time have a good balance in the boat. The trimming is more like "the cream on the cake".
<h6>The Crew</h6>
He has been sailing with a number of crew during his career. The most important, he thinks, is not to compare the different crew but to take care of the qualities of each man. The difficulty in cooperation between helmsman and crew is not, which can be assumed, the sailing itself and the technical parts but to get a well working communication. It is very important that you understand one anothers expressions.  In a regatta Krister takes no unnecessary risks at the beginning and he concentrates on the "safe sailing". 
At the end, however, Krister does not hesitate to put everything at stake if necessary and take a course of his own in order to maximize his chances to secure a front position. It can sometimes go completly wrong, like it did in the final race at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010306075457/http://www.int505.org/96wrac7.htm">'96 
Worlds in Townsville</a>.
<p>
<h6>Current Plans</h6>
He has this winter, besides reaching the age of 40, bought a new 5o5 (his tenth) from Rondar. He is working on new smaller rudder &amp; centerboard designs close to the very extreme type made of carbon fiber.
<p>
<h6>The Bergstrom Brothers</h6>
Besides Martin, whom Krister sailed 5o5 with during four years in the 70's, there is Rasmus - seen as crew on above picture.

After starting to sail 505s in Florida as a teenager, and an intercollegiate racing career at Tufts, Ethan went on to be a sailmaker with Van Zandt, Hood, Johnson and now North.  Ethan and boatbuilder Larry Tuttle developed the now standard North American rig in the late 70's after some near misses at the World Championship.  Ethan and Cam Lewis won the very competitive 1981 505 Worlds in San Francisco Bay.  Ethan continues to support the 505 class as a competitor, coach, and sailmaker.  Ethan and Cam have won the North Americans at least once since 1981, have been close at at least one Worlds and were back on the water in Hyannis for the '98 Worlds (racing the same boat they won in, in 1981!).  After not owning a 505 for 25 years - since he was a teenager - (but usually managing to have access to one to race), Ethan recently bought a Waterat 505. Ethan and his wife Trudy live in St. Petersburg FL, where they race Snipes occasionally as well.  They have two children.  <br clear="all">

Dylan learned to sail with his father Michael.  He remembers going out in the 5o5 when he was five.  He started crewing for his Dad in the 5o5 at age 12, after sailing 6-7 420 regattas, and was driving the 505 shortly afterwards.  At the age of 12, he drove the 505 in the '92 Hyannis Annual, and at the North American Championship the following year, with his Dad crewing.  The Breton's were one of the fastest teams downwind in those events.  Dylan is also into soccer, which also takes up weekends, so the Breton's cannot make all the East Coast events.
<p>
Dylan recently qualified for the US Junior Sailing Olympic program with his finish in a heavy air junior regatta.  He attributed his sucess in heavy air to his 505 experience.<br clear="all">

<p>
Marcel Buffet has been involved with the 505 from the earliest days of the class.  Racing against Paul Elvstrom and other famous sailors, he won the 1959 and 1960 World Championships.
<p>
Committed to the 505, he has raced in almost every 505 Worlds ever held, only missing a few while doing an Olympic Campaign in the Flying Dutchman.  He raced the heavy air 1992 Santa Cruz 505 Worlds at 71 years of age, raced in the 1995 Mounts Bay Worlds, finishing 24rd, and the 1996 Worlds in Townsville Australia, where he was 10th in the last race.  The French nespaper <i>La Telegramme</i> published

Peter Colclough is a legend in the 505 Class.  He has won the 505 World Championship four times, including 3 in a row from 1976 - 1978.  Almost ten years later, he won again in 1986.  Peter has only finished outside the top five once.  At the recent 1995 World Championship, Peter had his 17 year old son Ben crewing.  They won the 3rd race, and finished 10th overall.  Peter's downwind speed is nothing short of magical.<br clear="all">

Tim Collins was a top intercollegiate racer and all American.  He raced 470s, competing at Olympic trials and winning the 470 North American Championship.  He sold the 470s and bought a used 505 in 1996.  Tim races with Bill Smith on the New England and MidAtlantic circuit.  Tim and Bill recently bought an almost new Kulmar 505 built in Australia.  Tim and Bill won the 1998 505 East Coast Championship.

Ryan Cox was college sailor of the year in 1995.  He raced for the Naval Academy, and crewed for Tyler Moore for their 470 Olympic campaign.  Tyler and Ryan were 5th at the 1995 505 World Championship.  Ryan has since bought a new 505.  Ryan is a Seal in the navy, and is racing with Carl Smit, another long time 505 sailor, Naval Academy sailor, and now Navy SEAL, with the Hampton VA 505 fleet.<br clear="all">

Jesse (left) sailed keel boats much of his life before realizing that dinghy sailing is more fun and challenging, especially in a 505</a>.  Jesse was the captain of the Offshore Sailing Team at NY Maritime College (class of '91) and went on from there to campaign IMS boats.  In 1995, he bought and refurbished an old InterClub and resurrected the Annapolis InterClub Fleet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010306075457/http://www.clark.net/pub/ssa/Classes/InterClub.htm">http://www.clark.net/pub/ssa/Classes/InterClub.htm</a>.  Macy Nelson recruited Jesse to sail 505's in 1996.  Since then, Jesse has been campaigning a 505 with Barney Harris in 7772 and then 8643.  Jesse and Barney won the 1999 505 Midwinter Championship.  Jesse is a naval architect with Advanced Marine Enterprises, Inc. in Arlington VA.  He and his wife and two sons live in Annapolis MD.

<h4><a name="gesing">Teresca Gesing</a></h4>
I can remember Teresca sailing 505 with her parents in 1983 when 
she was about two or three.  With mother Renka driving, and father 
Adam on the wire, Teresca was given the mainsheet and told not 
to let it go.  The 505 popped up onto a plane and almost capsized 
when a puff hit, as Teresca, following instructions, did not ease 
the mainsheet.  Teresca now steers the family's Waterat 505, with 
Adam on the wire.  Renka is racing against them, in another 505.<br clear="all">

After years of surfing, and believing that sailboats were slow and boring, Howard was given a ride in a 505.  Despite no prior sailing experience, Howard immediately decided that racing 505s was for him, and he quickly became one of the best crews on the West Coast.  Howard then decided to build a better 505, and he built a set of tooling and started building the very innovative Hamlin 505 (after Howard stopped building boats, Waterat began building boats from the same tooling).  After several years of crewing with John Andron, and some narrow misses at the 505 World Championship, Howard started steering.  He raced with Jay Glaser on the wire for several years, with numerous top finishes.  More recently, Howard has been racing with Don Smith, Cam Lewis, and Mike Martin.  Howard and Cam won the heavy air pre-worlds event in '92 and were favorites to win the Worlds until Cam was injured and forced out of the regatta.  Howard and Mike Martin narrowly missed winning the '94 European Championship, and the '95 North American championship.  Howard and Cam Lewis narrowly missed winning the 1996 International 505 World Championship in Townsville Australia.  Later, Howard and Mike won the 1996 5o5 North American Championship.  Howard and Mike were 3rd at the '97 Worlds, 2nd at the '98 Worlds, and they won the 157 505 1999 World Championship.  
<p>
After several years of boatbuilding - his Hamlin tooling is still used to build the Waterat 505 - Howard decided not to be poor, and now is in real estate.<br clear="all">

<img src="/web/20010306075457im_/http://int505.org/pix/505_11s.gif" align="left">Barney Harris after narrowly missing a capsize. Barney Harris raced intercollegiate at the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY. While he was there, they were in the top 3 nationally, winning nationals twice. After graduating he raced Albacores for years in he Washington DC area, he still races the Albacore. He won the '94, '95, and '96  Albacore US Nationals, and was second at the '96 Canadian Nationals.  He has several top five finishes at the Albacore Worlds. He has also raced Snipes, Thistles, Highlander, Laser, J22, J24, Melges 24, Etchells, Sheilds, Ensign, El Toro and - he claims - anything else that floats.  Barney borrowed a 505 a couple of times over the past two years, and bought a used 505 in 1995. A few weeks later he was racing it for the first time at CORK. Barney took delivery of a new Waterat 505 in the spring of 1997 and is campaigning it with local crew and IC sailor Jesse Falsone.  Barney and Jesse won the 1999 505 Midwinter Championship. Barney is an engineer with a consulting company in the DC area.

Lots of people think you have to be young, male, tall and strong to race 505s.  People who think that have not met Marg Hurley.  Without mentioning age, Marg has been racing 505s for over twenty years, and she did not start right out of school either.  Marg is a little over five feet, and weighs about 110 pounds.  Marg bought her first 505 in 1977.
She and ace crew Howie Turner raced against Marg's boyfriend - and longtime 505 sailor - Peter Wood, who bought an identical new 505 at the same time.  Marg and Howie beat Peter most of the time that summer. After years of racing against each other, Peter's protests that he was a terrible crew were ignored, and Marg recruited him to crew for her.
They have been racing together now for almost ten years; Peter is a better crew than he let on, and Marg is one of the top 505 skippers in Canada, winning the Fleet Four Invitational in 1996.
<p>
Marg is one of the toughest sailors I have ever met.  In the first race of the day at one of her first 505 regattas, the 1977 Eastern Canadian Championship, she was hit in the head during a gybe, opening a gash in the top of her head.  She couldn't see for all the blood in her eyes, but finished the race anyhow with Howie telling her "come up a little, ok now down a little".  Back on shore she was cleaned up, and was back out there for the next three races, in winds gusting to over 30 knots.  She capsized in every remaining race, and still finished every one.  
<p>
Marg works for the Canadian government.<br clear="all"> 

<h4><a name="tjohnson">Todd Johnson</a></h4>
<a href="pix/505_321.JPG"><img src="/web/20010306075457im_/http://int505.org/pix/505_321s.GIF">Tom Kivney and Todd Johnson blasting upwind at the '97 East Coast Championship</a>.
Todd believes himself to actually be older than his team mate Tom Kivney, and Tom assures him that such is the case.  But, there are occasions when neither acts their age.  As a result, neither is sure of anything....except that on a consistent basis they are the oldest crew in combined ages out there.  Being as they are both something north of 45 they are (1) happy to still be around, (2) happy to still be sailing 5-ohs, (3) convinced that they can rig and derig #8194 faster than anyone in North America can rig or derig any other boat and (4) amazed that they seem to still be reasonably competitive.  What is most remarkable is that until 1997 they had not “hooked up” to sail together on a dedicated basis....despite living a mere four miles from each other.
<p>
Todd first sailed a 505 as Mike Loeb’s crew in 1971, bought Sandy VanZandt’s #4237 in 1973 (Tom’s brother Gerard was Todd’s regular crew) and sold it to Steve Taylor (Steve’s first 505) in 1976.  In 1977 Todd and Stan Bartlett (both then in Chicago) bought Bill Pevear’s #5190 and sailed in the Waukegan fleet for several years before donating the boat to the Univ. of Wisconsin Hoofers sailing club in 1982.  Todd then went the way of all sin, sailing many different boats including...(oh for shame) lots of offshore lead mines....until 1994 when old friend Barry Kuehl, at the prompting of Tom Kivney (with whom Todd had been sailing for spring practice), talked him into a 5-oh regatta in Marblehead.  It was all uphill from there, once again, for Todd....who immediately recognized he had wasted a number of years of his life sailing other boats.
<p>
Todd steered the American UFO one-design (a 28’ 505 look-alike with a keel) at the Centomeglia regatta on Lake Garda, Italy in September of 1996.  Finished 5th of 19 in the Centomeglia race and 2nd for the week.  He has nearly 150,000 offshore racing miles under his belt (for whatever that’s worth), sails occasionally in the International 210 Class in the Boston area, and coordinated the Finn Class carbon mast and sail development program for USOYC prior to the 1996 Olympic Games.
<p>
More recently, Todd and family moved to the Washington DC area (actually Annapolis), where he expects to be active with 505 fleet 19.

<h4><a name="kelly">Stu Kelly</a></h4>
So you are driving down the road, and something on one side catches your eye - a strange-looking sailboat missing a foredeck, slowly rotting away. You have little sailing experience, and have no idea what kind of boat it is; what do you do?
<p>
If you are Stu Kelly, you buy the boat, take it home, and rebuild it, piece by piece.  Stu has done a magnificent rebuild on an early 70's Parker 505.  The boat has been mistaken by non 505 sailors for a new boat.
<p>
Stu crews within the WRSC fleet, and has been upgrading his boat with some current control systems.  Stu is expected to be a very strong contender in  the "classic" 505 division with his bright red beauty.  Stu and his family live near Annapolis.<br clear="all">

Cam makes his living sailing; the only boat he races for free is the 505.  As do many other  crews, Cam owns the boat and looks for good drivers.   Crews are as important, if not more important, than helms in 505s. He got Ethan Bixby around the course fast enough to win the '81 Worlds, and Gary Knapp around fast enough to win in '82.  He and Ethan or Howard Hamlin have had several near misses since, including narrowly missing winning the 1996 505 World Championship.

Jeff and his good friend Bob Sutton sailed El Toro's as kids in the San Francisco Bay area until one day they saw a 505.  Jeff and Bob promptly got into the 505 class, and have been racing them ever since.  One of the advantages of starting
in the 505 class early is that you can have 20+ years experience, and still be young enough to be in school! (in fairness, Jeff has taken his time getting his Ph.D.!, and graduated quite recently).

<h4><a name="moss">Shona Moss</a></h4>
I remember seeing Shona and her sister Joanna trapezing from each side of the family 505 on a light air day, when neither had reached ten years of age.  An early start in racing high performance dinghies may be part of the reason Shona chose to do an Olympic campaign in the Europe dinghy.  She won the Canadian Olympic trials, and represented Canada in the '92 Olympics.  That done with, she returned to her red 505.  Shona and Steve lived and raced in Edmonton, setting the pace for the Alberta and Saskatchewan 505 fleets, and have very recently moved to Guelph, Ontario.  Shona is an exercise physiologist.<br clear="all">

Chris's first serious exposure to 505s was at the 1996 Florida SailFest, in almost no wind, while he was still attending ODU.  It was enough to hook Chris, who was back in Florida a few weeks later racing a chartered 505 in the Midwinter Championship.  Chris then bought a twenty-year-old-but-still-game Parker-hulled Lindsay 505, 6311, fixed it up and raced it with some good finishes.  He more recently bought a used UK 505 site unseen and is now racing Rondar 8240.  Chris lives in Newport RI.

After racing an old Parker 505, Mike moved up to a more serious 505 racing program. He raced the '90 and '92 Worlds, multiple North Americans, and most East Coast events.  Mike won the '93 East Coast Championships, with Ali Meller.  Living close to the club, Mike and Lorna put up most out-of-town 505 sailors visiting WRSC.  Mike was fleet captain of fleet 19 until he moved to the West Coast recently.  The East Coast's loss is the West Coast's gain.  Mike is currently racing 505s with Swedish expatriate Johan Backsin.    Mike works in Safeway's real estate group.<br clear="all">

<h4><a name="torrie">Ian Torrie</a></h4>
Who says you have to have a big crew for 505s?  Ian Torrie and brother Alec started racing 505s as teenagers in the late '70s,  in Eastern Canada.  Both were under 140 pounds, and neither is much over 5 foot tall.  Being short and light didn't seem to bother them, as they proceeded to be one of  the top teams in Eastern Canada.  Ian, now living in Vancouver with wife Michelle, recently decided to steer rather than crew, and bought a Lindsay 505, growing the Vancouver fleet by doing so.  More recently Ian and Michelle moved to Canada's maritime (eastern) provinces, and Ian's rebuilt 505 is turning up at East Coast events.  Ian is a doctor in the Canadian navy.<br clear="all">

<a href="pix/505_23.gif"><img src="/web/20010306075457im_/http://int505.org/pix/505_23s.gif" align="left">Nick Trotman (left) and Michael Mills</a>.
Nick Trotman is a two time all-American.  He races with Brown U sailing coach Mike Mills.  They were 9th at the 1995 505 World Championship, 3rd at the 1995 East Coast Championship, and narrowly missed winning the '97 NAs, finishing 3rd.  Nick and Mike bought a new Rondar 505 in 1996 and are one of the fastest New England 505 teams.  Recently Nick was on the US team - Pablo Picasso - that won the UK Team Racing Championship.  Then Nick and Mike won the 1998 505 World Championship, the first US team to win the 505 Worlds since 1982!  Nick is faster than his sister, bronze medal winner in the Europe dinghy, at the '90 Barcelona Olympics.<br clear="all">

<h4><a name="wulff">Warren Wulff</a></h4>
Warren used to daysail an old 505 on Lake Champlain.  He moved to the Syracuse area and is now day sailing and club racing a newer 505 nearby. With a little bit of help getting up to speed, Warren will be out racing with us at the occasional Ontario and East Coast event.  In the meantime racing handicap in a 505 isn't too bad as the boat is much faster than anything else on the lake.<br clear="all">

<h4><a name="zani">Mike Zani</a></h4>
Mike is an exceptional sailor with an exceptional record.  After driving a 505 in a couple of events, Mike got together with Peter Alarie, and bought a 16 year old Lindsay 505 - from Nick Trotman - which they have rebuilt.  Despite Mike and Peter's many sailing commitments, they manage to find time to do the 505 circuit.  Apart from all the other wins that follow, Mike and Peter won the '97 International 505 North American Championship in Long Beach
