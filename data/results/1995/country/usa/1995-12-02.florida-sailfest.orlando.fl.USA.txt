Florida Sailfest 1995
Last Updated January 24, 1995

I have no idea how many boats, and how many classes were there! It
seemed like at least one of any class you had ever heard of, and lots
you had not, were there. I mean really, an Aussie B14 complete with two
Aussies? Flying Scots, Highlanders, cats, Optimists, One Design 14s, FDs
Snipes, JY15s, and lots more.

The 505s had five boats, representing 400% growth in the Sailfest 505
fleet over last year (one boat, which won Open Planing Division). There
were two local (Florida) boats, both recent additions to the Florida
fleet.

We had a very competetive 505 fleet (including a college sailor of the
year and 5th at the 1995 505 Worlds, Laser National champion, past 505
world champion, ant current US Albacore champion.) One team won a race,
and was last in the next.

Chris Museler drove down with Barney Harris and George Saunders in
"spot", towing two boats. Chris sailed 8263 with George. Chris is now
looking for a good used 505, preferably a Lindsay. Andrew Cole brought
4596, a vintage Parker, and sailed with Ali Meller.

Florida locals and defending Sailfest champions, Paula Sue Gilbert and
Dave Fratantoni could not make it.

Andrew Cole in 4596 wins Classic Division - not recognized by Sailfest,
but by the 505 Class. Dylan Bixby won Optimist white fleet.

The weather was overcast with some breeze on Saturday, sunny and glass
calm Sunday. The water in the lake is opaque! Brown bow waves!

Check out these photographs of racing on Sunday!

Moore/Cox and Harris/Smith dueling down the 2nd reach. Photo taken from
Meller/Cole boat a litte ways behind. Meller/Cole passed Harris/Smith on
the next leg, the final beat of the race. Note the intense
concentration........ Museler/Saunders are ahead of these two, and went
on to be first boat across the finish line despite being on the second
start. The 505s sailed through the entire leadmine fleet, including the
high performance ones.

The view astern from the Meller/Cole boat. An unnamed former 505 World
Champion is in last, dying with the keelboats. If he ever gets going, he
can look forward to drifting around the leeward mark, while the
leadmines have shut off what little air there is (next photo)

Another look astern from the Meller/Cole boat. Take at look at this
leeward mark! You do not want to be back there with all those leadmines!

We appear to have a resurgent Florida 505 fleet. Mark Mendelblatt and
his brother are interested in a 505. Several other Floridians are
apparently interested in the 505 class. We had lots of questions about
the boats.

Sailfest had seminars, massive amounts of free beer, dinner, food,
orange juice and yogurt in the morning, and all for $70!

See you at the Midwinters!
