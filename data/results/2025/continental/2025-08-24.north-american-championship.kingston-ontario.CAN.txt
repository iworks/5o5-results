505 North American Championship 2025 at Kingston Yacht Club

After four days of thrilling competition on the waters of the St.
Lawrence River, 505 class legends Howie Hamlin and Jeff Nelson secured
their first 505 North American Championship title as a team, adding
another championship feather to their cap. Battling it out for the
podium, Mike Martin / Adam Lowry finished second, while Mike Holt / Carl
Smit rounded out the podium in third.

This will be Hamlin's eighth and Nelson's fifth North American title,
but this year is the first time they've been able to clinch the title as
a team.

"There's nothing like winning, but this one is extra sweet. Jeff and
I have been sailing together for many years, and yet the North Americans
trophy has eluded us, so it was really important for me to finally
deliver the speed that Jeff needs to execute his tactical brilliance,"
said Hamlin.

"Jeff's just a phenomenal sailor. In 505 sailing there's nothing harder
than crewing - crews have to be a 220 pound ballerina that's a tactical
genius and who can make the boat go fast, and Jeff delivers on all of
those things."

"We talked a little bit before the week, it's Howard's 50th anniversary
of his first NAs, it's my 25th, and it certainly hasn't gotten easier
over the years," said Nelson of the event. "It felt great to win in this
venue where it's been more moderate conditions, not just a one-side race
track that's all about boatspeed; it was very tactically difficult and
tricky both upwind and downwind."

Hamlin and Nelson excelled in the mid-range conditions, where they were
able to use their tactical skills to best their competition. They credit
their consistency, good starts, and downwind speed to their success. And
what a success it was - the pair won seven of 12 races, with only two
scores outside the top five.

Hosted by the Kingston Yacht Club, the 2025 championship brought
together 36 teams from across the United States and Canada, showcasing
the depth, talent, and camaraderie of the 505 class. From world
champions to parent-child teams and new faces in the fleet, competitors
celebrated what makes the class unique: speed, skill, and community.

The regatta kicked off a solid east breeze, unusual for Kingston, as
a building thermal breeze carried the fleet through four competitive
opening races. Early leaders Mike Holt/Carl Smit were closely trailed by
Hamlin/Nelson and Nic Baird/Eric Anderson, setting the stage for
a tightly contested championship.

Mid-regatta, Hamlin and Nelson hit their stride in the moderate,
flat-water conditions, delivering a string of podium finishes that
positioned them firmly atop the standings. Behind them, the battle for
the remaining podium spots intensified. A tie between Mike Martin/Adam
Lowry and Mike Holt/Carl Smit kept the pressure high, while
Baird/Anderson and Doug Hagan/Arne Wittemer remained in striking
distance, with few points between them in fourth and fifth,
respectively.
