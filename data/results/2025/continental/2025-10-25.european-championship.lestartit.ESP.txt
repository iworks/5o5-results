505er Europa-Meisterschaft bei Starkwind und Flaute

505er Europa-Meisterschaft bei Starkwind und Flaute
29 Oktober, 2025

Die 505er haben ihre Europa-Meisterschaft 2025 in L’Estartit/Spanien
abgeschlossen. Es war ein fantastischer Event mit einem HSC-Team unter
den Top-20.

58 Teams aus USA, England, Australien, Deutschland, Frankreich, Schweiz,
Canada und Italien segelten in traumhafter Umgebung und Spätsommer-Sonne
auf höchstem Niveau. Fast die gesamte Weltspitze war vertreten. Nur die
Skandinavier und Polen fehlten wegen der sehr weiten Anreise. Während
die Wettfahrten an den ersten beiden Tagen bei Starkwind absolviert
wurden, fand an den weiteren beiden Tagen wegen zu wenig Wind kein
Rennen mehr statt.

Es siegten Roger Gilbert und Ian Mitchell aus England punktgleich vor
Jan-Philipp Hofmann und Felix Brockerhoff aus Düsseldorf. Auf Platz
3 folgte die 505er-Legende Howard Hamlin aus den USA mit Andy Zinn. Bei
wirklich herausfordernden Starkwind-Bedingungen konnte Tim Böger (HSC)
mit Sohn Finn einen hervorragenden 16.Platz belegen …

Gratulation! Aus dem Hamburger Segel-Club folgten auf weiteren Plätzen
Markus Schöner (38.), Andreas Jungclaus (51.) und Walter Steding (52.).

Nicht nur die sportliche Performance auf dem Wasser war Werbung für die
Klasse. Auch die sympatische internationale Community zeigte erneut,
warum wir dieses tolle Boot segeln.

505 European Championship 2025 at Club Nàutic Estartit
by Charles Dwyer 30 Oct 17:02 GMT

The International 505 Class headed to the town of L'Estartit on Spain's
Costa Brava for its European Championships this year. It's the first
time the Class have held an international event in Spain and it was
a great success - not least because in late October the weather was far
better and warmer than a rain-lashed Northern Europe.

58 teams competed which is a superb entry away from the 505s traditional
strongholds. Most boats arrived on multi-trailers - some of which had
been purpose built and donated for the event.

Before the event started we did some short sprints and practised gate
starts - useful for the competitors but also to enable the Spanish race
team led by PRO Tim Hancock to learn how to do gate starts - which they
then ran flawlessly throughout the event.

The wind seemed to be driven by a combination of strong katabatic
mountain winds to the North and to the South, local geographic features
such as the Medes Islands and local thermal effects. This meant that
conditions changed quickly and forecasts were of very limited use.

The first racing day was Thursday - it dawned with light to medium winds
but once we got out there it was a solid 15-18 knots with a good sea
running - in other words perfect 505 conditions. International Class
President Michael Quirk and Tim Needham duly blasted out of the gate
early and led at the top mark with GBR's Roger Gilbert and Ian Mitchell
just about keeping in touch.

These boats extended on the fleet for the remainder of the race with
Gilbert/Mitchell managing to pass Quirk/Needham in the final couple of
gybes to the finish. Many people's pre-event favourites, German
Champions Jan-Philipp Hofmann and Felix Brockerhoff used their downwind
ability to recover from fairly deep to 3rd at the finish.

For the second race Gilbert/Mitchell started early and got inside a big
lift to have a huge lead at the first mark - downwind USA's Mike Holt
and Rob Woelfel cleverly used the leaders to gauge the breeze and closed
the distance right up. With no changes on the second beat it looked like
the race was over. Hofmann/Brockerhoff had other ideas. They gybed early
having seen pressure along the shore and trapezed flat out for the whole
leg.

Meanwhile the leaders were dead running in very little breeze and could
only look on as Felix and Jan-Phiipp flew in from the right gybed into
a controlling position and triumphantly took the winners gun to put
themselves right back into contention overall. Gilbert/Mitchell were
overnight leaders (just).


On Friday the fleet launched into the edge of some very strong mountain
winds and had gusts of 30+ knots before the start. This moderated
a little as the gate start got under way. Quirk/Needham stormed to
a lead at the first mark but tangled spinnaker clews saw
Gilbert/Mitchell take over with GBRs Paul Brotherton and James Fawcett
in hot pursuit with Manxman Michael Wilson and Stu Bithell also in the
mix. The lead changed hands a few times before Gilbert/Mitchell used
their upwind speed to close out a second win.

The wind then died for 20 minutes or so before filling back in ready for
race 4. In the lighter moderate breeze North American Champion Howard
Hamelin and Andy Zinn were first round, expertly gybed into a gust and
extended away to make their win look easy (although it was anything but
with passing lanes aplenty both upwind and down). GBR's Ben McGrane and
James Ross sailed their best race to bring home a second with
Hofmann/Brockerhoff finding their stride in third.

The breeze kicked in again with a solid race 6 win for
Hofmann/Brockerhoff, with Hamelin/Zinn second. The minor placings were
a scrap right to the finish with Holt/Woelfel using all their experience
to hold on for 3rd place.

By now the wind was gusting 30+ knots again as a tired fleet battled
a long beat home in gusty, shifty winds that was funnelling between the
islands and the shore and so got worse as we got closer to the marina.
Ashore it was warm and sunny as the fleet relaxed into the daily après
sail routine of free food and beer dockside. Gilbert/Mitchell kept the
overnight lead on countback from Hofmann/Brockerhoff.


The mountain driven winds moved away overnight so Saturday was
a beautifully sunny day - but no wind - despite the best efforts of the
race team who spent a long day on the water waiting/hoping for a thermal
breeze that never came.

Instead Howie Hamelin led a debrief session where the sailors had a Q&A
asking the front of the fleet how they had set up, how they had sailed
and whether that had worked or not. This was a great hit with Felix
Brockerhoff, Mike Holt, Rob Woelfel and Andy Zinn particularly helpful.

Everyone learnt something and I don't think anyone there will forget
Rob's fully acted description of his and Holtie's super slick (but
borderline insane to the uninitiated) gybing technique - overcoming
g-force to come in off the wire after the boat is already turning hard
downwind.

Sunday dawned grey and colder with a promising forecast of 7-9 knots
- the fleet duly launched on time but without significant heating and no
mountain winds the fleet spent the day afloat waiting for a fickle
breeze that never stabilised or filled in despite some promising signs.
After a long wait the race team finally called it a day at 3pm.

Roger Gilbert and Ian Mitchell therefore became European Champions by
the narrowest of margins, with pre-event favourites Jan-Philipp Hofmann
and Felix Brockerhoff beaten for the first time this year and
California's Howard Hamelin and Andy Zinn completing the podium.

German team Nicola Birkner and Angela Stenger retained the Women's prize
while French light wind aces Florence Lebrun and Ludovic Roblin won the
mixed prize. GBR's Gary Fowler and Harry Moffat were delighted to win
the Classics Prize which was a just reward for getting their vintage
Kyrwood round in some very testing conditions.

The 2025 505 Europeans was a very successful and well attended event,
not least because of the support of local volunteers, the Spanish and
Catalan Sailing Federations, as well as the local town council and Club
Nautic Estartit. Thanks also to our world class Principal Race Officer
(and former 505 World Champion) Tim Hancock for his commitment to the
class and for his immeasurable contribution to making this event
a success.

The GBR 505 teams continued their resurgence with 4 in the top 10 for
the first time in many years. 11 GBR boats made the trip with half
coming from Hayling Island Sailing Club.

Our next European events will be the 2026 Easter Eurocup traditionally
held in the South of France followed by Garda in May and then the Class
World Championships at Hayling Island 2-11 July 2026.

So far as the UK is concerned, this autumn/winter there is an Open
Winter Series at Hayling Island which will be well attended by 50s (all
welcome), then leading into the Spring where we will have a good mix of
training events, 50-Friday sailing and competitive regattas all leading
towards the Worlds at Hayling in July.

Preparations are well advanced for the Hayling Worlds and we are
anticipating a turnout of 100+ boats. If you would like to get involved
and try a 505 then please contact us and we will be delighted to assist.
