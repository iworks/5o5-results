505 open meeting at Hayling Island Sailing Club by Charlie Walters 27
    May 15:39 BST

Ten intrepid teams gazed across Chichester Harbour, under the
board-stiff flags flying off the Hayling clubhouse — the wind gods
offering early hints of what was in store for the weekend:
West-South-Westerly winds at 20-24 knots and a big, steep swell.

Sharing the venue and racecourse with the Ospreys and Flying Fifteen
fleets, the 505s were also bolstered by several new crews — all with one
eye firmly on 2-10 July 2026, when Hayling Island SC will host the 505
World Championships.

From the home club, we welcomed two new teams to the fleet: Judith
Williamson and Dan Martin (sailing 9180), and Rob Gullan and Paul Childs
(9232). From Burghfield SC, Simon Potts and Rob Allen (8929) joined the
action.

And then there were the reformed 505 teams. Sailing the newly acquired
9236 — a beautiful boat previously owned by class legend Neil Fulcher
— Jim Blyth was crewed once again by Darrel Samanjoul. This team
reunited after a short sailing break... of just ten years.

Outdone only by the ex-Fireball duo of Andy Smith and Johnny Mildred
(9214), who were "getting the band back together" after a 13-year
hiatus. All were welcome additions to the fleet, and all acquitted
themselves admirably considering what unfolded out in the bay.

Charlie Walters was expertly crewed by Alex Davies as a scratch team in
9085. Roger Gilbert and Ian Mitchell (9215) were expected to be the form
team, but frankly, the conditions were looking testy for everyone.

The 505s sailed a two-lap outer loop trapezoid course. This meant two
exciting reaches across the waves, two white-knuckle rides down the run,
and increasingly large short-fetch waves approaching the leeward end of
the course.

Race 1

A tight battle at the front between locals Rob Gullan & Paul Childs and
Roger Gilbert & Ian Mitchell, with the lead swapping several times. The
chasing group — Simon Potts & Rob Allen, Andy Smith & Johnny Mildred,
Charlie & Alex, and Jim & Darrel — stayed close, ready to pounce on any
mistakes.

Positions shuffled often, but Roger & Ian took the bullet. Rob & Paul
were called OCS. Charlie & Alex, along with Jim & Darrel, slipped past
the Burghfield team after a course error in tricky visibility.

Race 2

Roger & Ian led again, with Rob & Paul close behind and both showing
strong upwind pace. Charlie & Alex held third comfortably, while Jim
& Darrel remained solid in fourth.

Race 3

Attrition set in — both sailors and kit were taking a beating. Only
three 505s made the start. Challenging conditions and plenty of stories
for the bar - frankly the top reach required more rugby skills than
    sailing, with the cross-swell causing real problems for all the
    crews on what was now a broad two-sail reach.

By day's end, Roger & Ian led overall, with Charlie & Alex second, and
Jim & Darrel stalking in third. Most crews had varying levels of
overnight repairs in the boat park before dinner, and a fantastic
evening in the bar with the Flying Fifteen and Osprey teams.

Sunday dawned even windier and wavier, so the PRO wisely kept the fleet
inside Chichester Harbour on a windward/leeward course. Only Race 4 was
sailed before conditions became too strong to continue.

The water was flatter, the gusts were larger (up towards 30 knots). Most
entertainingly, Sunday brought the chance to bear away at the windward
mark, hoist the spinnaker, and point the boat straight toward the
oncoming Flying Fifteen fleet (who started six minutes behind). Good
seamanship across all the fleets kept boats safely apart, though the
closing speeds in the restricted waterway would make many marine
insurers wince.

Race 4

Rob & Paul, having missed Race 3 on Saturday with a minor "mast
un-alignment" issue, came out firing with an audacious port-tack flyer
from the pin end as the breeze topped 25 knots. Charlie & Alex pulled
through to lead at Mark 1 — shifts more than speed doing the work, as
the wind repeatedly swung 15 degrees across the course.

A game of snakes and ladders followed, as the boats planed upwind in 25
knots across the flat waters of the harbour.

Roger & Ian held on to a monster 30 knot gust downwind to lead at the
leeward mark. Then both they and Charlie & Alex were caught on the wrong
side of the same 20+degree shift that had bitten Rob & Paul on the first
beat. Roger & Ian extended for the clean sweep; Charlie & Alex dropped
back, though still safe in second; Rob & Paul crossed in third.

With the breeze building further, racing was sensibly abandoned,
followed by a well-earned lunchtime prize-giving.

Our thanks to all at Hayling Island for two great days on the water and
a fantastic Saturday night social with the Fifteens and Ospreys. This
weekend set a great tone for the upcoming Nationals in Weymouth. See you
all 26-29 June!
