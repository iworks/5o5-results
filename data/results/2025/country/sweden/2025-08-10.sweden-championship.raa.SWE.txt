International 505 Class

Carl-Fredrik Fock/Johan Barne, SWE, winners of Euro Cup 4 and the
Swedish Nationals

After two days with light to moderate wind, the final day was sailed in
17-25 knots, outside Råå in Sweden. Gorgeous planning conditions!

Carl Fredrik Fock/Johan Barne, SWE, won the first two races and decided
to stay ashore in the last, since they had already won the regatta.
Carl-Fredrik Fock is a former European Champion and World ranking leader
in 470 and Johan Barne has a second place in the 505 Worlds 2003 with
Krister Bergström as well as two Swedish Nationals titles. So, the
merits of the 2025 Swedish champions and Euro Cup 4 winners are solid.

Fabiola and Michael Wonterghem, DEN, won the last race, lifting them to
fifth place. Fourth place went to Jens Biederer/Thomas Wasilewski, GER,
while the podium was all Swedish. After Barne/Fock, in second place
Malin Broberg/Johan Röök, and in third place Peter Bökmark/Martin
Persson.

A well-organized regatta by Råå Dinghy Club, great camaraderie ashore,
and very nice sailing!
