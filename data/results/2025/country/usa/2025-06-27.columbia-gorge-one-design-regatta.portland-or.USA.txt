We had a really fun CGOD regatta at the Gorge a couple weeks ago. The
weather was great, the beer was cold, and the barbeque was delicious.

Clark Hayes repeated his victory from last year, sailing with Eric
Schwab who flew in from Corpus Cristi. One point behind were Mike
Punnett and Rich Mundell. Two points further back were Pierre Jeangirard
and Langdon Junge.
