ABYC Manning Regatta report

Doug Hagan/Shane Illidge, Mike Punnett/Don Smith plus Matt Merchant and
I, had 3 great days of training before the ABYC Manning regatta last
weekend.

We had 7 boats for the Regatta in spite of many boats still in the
Adelaide container and me not promoting the event.

ABYC raced us outside the breakwater Saturday with 3 moderate air races.
Very tight tricky racing with the top 5 boats. Doug/Shane rounded first
at the first mark of each race. Mike/Don were always right there. Jon
& Lauren Bell were fast. Tim & Gavin Murphy had their moments in Doug's
boat. The two San Diego teams were having fun and got loads of tips.
Somehow Matt and I were able to sneak into the lead by the end of each
race.

Sunday was a solid 20-25 knots clearing westerly. Perfect conditions.
Three teams went out. Doug & Jon teamed up and won the first race.
Mike/Don won the second race. Matt and I hung on for a couple seconds.

Nice long debriefs everyday. Results below.

Btw, the Sept 26-28th "Skiff Regatta" at ABYC is a 3 day event. I think
the calendar shows only 2 days. To maximise attendance, here is the
schedule:

Friday 3pm start so you have the morning to travel. Saturday 1:30pm
start. Sunday noon start.

Hope to see you all there.
