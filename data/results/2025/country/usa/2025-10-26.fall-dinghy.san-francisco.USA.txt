This past weekend, many of the West Coast 505 sailors were away at the
European Championship. However 22 of the smartest 505 sailors competed
in the StFYC Fall Dinghy Regatta.  We had 6 races over 2 days that
presented the fleet with a wide variety of conditions ranging from
sit-running in 5 knots to wire-running in 15-18 knots.  There were
a bunch new faces like Jack Jorgensen sailing with Matt Merchant who on
Sunday rounded all of the first windward marks in the lead. Also Beckett
Shinn sailing with Ian O'Leary who has some great first beats. Andrea
Ciccardi was sailing with Luke Draper in his new boat.  Speaking of new
boats, Tim Murphy christened his beautiful new Ovington sailing the
event with Aaron Ziegler. There was also some reappearances of some
veteran faces like Nick Adamson sailing with Steve Bourdow. As usual
after sailing there was a great social session with taco bar at the club
on Saturday and a big Lasagna dinner on Sunday.  Overall it was a great
event.
