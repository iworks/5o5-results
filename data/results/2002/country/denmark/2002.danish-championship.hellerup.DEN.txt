Danish Nationals 2002
by Tom BÃ¸jland
Dear sailors,

The Danish Nationals was sailed in nice and sunny weather over the last
3 days in Hellerup/Copenhagen. The wind was from 3 to 15 knots.

We had a Barbercue Friday, a party saturday, and beer after the races
everyday.

18 boats were racing, of which 6 were sailing their first season. One of
these was a boat from Norway. (Ed. we may have a Norwegian 505 fleet
soon)

Jacob Boisen Moller, hired his brother Jorgen (Jorgen hasn't been
sailing 505s since 1978 but has been wasting his time winning some
Olympic medals and World Championships in the FD), and they showed all
the youngsters how to sail a 505 by winning all the races (1 OCS).
