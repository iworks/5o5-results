Belgium Open Championship
La Plate Taille

After Detlefs message I feel someone from Belgium should at least put
a brief summary of our championship held September 26-27 while the big
guys were packing there stuff in Hyannis. This summary will be very
brief since I was sailing far behind the first boats where the
interesting action was happening. In any case it was a very nice race,
we had 40 boats participating, with about half the boats coming from
France, a couple of boats coming from Germany and the remainder from
Belgium. The first start was given at 2pm on saturday with about 10
knots with puffs of about 15 knots. Three races were run and although
the races were very tight Bart Meynendonkx and Chris Lehouck managed to
score 3 first places. I heard the evening dinner was really nice.

Sunday we started at 10:30 am with winds somewhat lighter and much
shiftier than Saturday. Three races were held and with wind that was
shifting a lot there were many changes in the fleet and the arrival
order changed a lot for every race. The races finished around 2pm with
a prize-giving ceremony at 3pm.
