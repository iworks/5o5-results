The fleet was small but the competition was very, very good. Jan
Saugmann & Morten Ramsbaek was close behind Krister/Thomas and if there
had been racing on the last day it could well have been a Danish victory
this year. Jorgen Schonherr and Anders Kaempe had teamed up together
once again and was also up there chasing these guys. The racing was held
on the waters outside Åhus in quite strong wind. We had two days racing
only, on the last day it was too much to go sailing and be shure to
bring yourself & the boat back. The 5th race, on the second day, was
really tough. 15 m/s steady breeze with 21 m/s puffs! Krister was hit
close to the eyes by the spinpole end (in a take-down). He looked real
nice with blood all over when returning to the harbour and I think Kalle
Nilsson was glad to see that motorboat which came to his rescue and
saved his life... Kalle was in the drink with a big hole in the drysuit
and had lost contact with the boat just before they had crashlanded on
the shore. One boat got damaged, SWE8619, the hull is anyhow in good
hands at Holger Jess and the rig at Jacob Bojsen Moller to be repaired
in time before the container transport to Hyannis. Well, we all
recovered and Johan, Anna & Dietrich did a great job fixing the barbeque
at Johan's and Anna's home. In the evening after the first day of
sailing we had an international football game between helmsmans and
crews. The helmsmans won the game surprisingly easy with 5-3 (using
Norwegian tactics) but lost the penalty-kick final. Of course its better
with a big crew to cover up the goal than a tiny helmsman...

Many thanks to Johan Arvedson and all the folks involved at Åhus
KappseglingsClub.
