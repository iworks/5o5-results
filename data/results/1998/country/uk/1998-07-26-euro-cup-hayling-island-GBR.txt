505 EuroCup, Hayling Island Sailing Club,
24 to 26 July 1998

Friday: Two races. Sea breeze, force 3 maybe just reaching 4.

Saturday: Three races. Sea breeze, force 2 to 3. Tricky spring tide.

Sunday: One race. Drizzly, with a front coming through, force 2 to 3,
swinging & dying to nothing. Many boats failed to finish in the time
limit.
