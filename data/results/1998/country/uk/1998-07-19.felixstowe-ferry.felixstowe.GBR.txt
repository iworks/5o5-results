505s at Felixstowe Ferry

Felixstowe Ferry S.C. kindly hosted the 505s over the weekend 18 - 19
July, with Fireflies and Larks. Tim O'Leary officiated with panache,
with helpers from the Squib fleet, some of whom were ex-505 sailors
regretting not being in the action.

Saturday's wind was fresh with a lively chop. Jim Berry, [UK] class
president, crewed by David Barnes, returning after a lay-off, showed
good speed at times. They took race one from early leader, Tom Wain and
Jon Peats, followed by Rob Napier and Kimball Morrison who had taken
a swim. In race two, Peter Andreae and Rob Stallard led for most of the
race, but capsized. Nevertheless, a consistent 4,2,2,3 earned them the
Rose Bowl and the G&J Cup for best helm and crew from the home club.

Sunday was brighter and smoother, force 2 - 3 increasing to 3 - 4, with
the ever-changing ebb tide from the Deben giving interesting tactical
choices. Rob Napier and Kimball Morrison won both races, and the Ferry
Plate.
