Posted on June 20, 2022 by PaulPlace

Winners of NOD 2022 Kyber Lovshin and Christian Voyer, they are the
youngest 505 team to ever win NOD. They showed very good sailing skills
in the 4 race series in challenging conditions. Another young team, Paul
Place and Jacob Livingstone placed 2nd. Marie Gendron and David Browne
finished 3rd. The fleet only raced on Sunday as Saturday weather was out
of control. Results are available on the NSC NOD website.
