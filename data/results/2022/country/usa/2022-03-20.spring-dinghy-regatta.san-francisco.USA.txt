505 American Section

Here are the results from last weekend's St Francis Spring Dinghy
Regatta - Spring Dinghy (theclubspot.com). Congrats to Mike H and Rob
W for taking out the win in a typically ridiculously competitive fleet. 

Many of you know that the Class now has a pair of GoPro cameras to
capture videos from regattas and other Class events, and here is a clip
of the winners sailing the top of the beat and beginning of the run in
one of the races.

Big thanks to Aaron Ross for managing the cameras and files, and to
Mike/Rob and Mike Martin and Caleb Paine for sailing with cameras. 

Installing a mount or mounts on your boat is easy and makes putting
a Class camera on your boat quick and easy. Good locations are top of
transom, under side of boom, and underneath the ram. 

More videos will eventually be posted. Media is very cool and requires
a correspondingly high level of input to manage. Once again, we
appreciate your patience with this project.
