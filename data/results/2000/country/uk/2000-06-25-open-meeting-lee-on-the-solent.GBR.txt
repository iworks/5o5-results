Lee-on-Solent SC, 24-25 June 2000

Hector Cisneros reports:

A small but very competitive fleet of 505's gathered for the open
meeting at Lee-on-Solent over the weekend of the 24th and 25th of June.
The first race was started in a very shifty force 2-3. It was a Robinson
family benefit at the top mark with Clive leading from son Christopher.
However, by the end of the first run Hector Cisneros had come through to
take the lead, only to lose out up the next windward leg to both Clive
Robinson and Andy Williams. Robinson stayed in front to the finish and
although there was much place changing behind, Williams held onto second
from the fast finishing Dave Smithwhite.

Race two started in less wind and again it was Clive Robinson leading at
the first mark but as the breeze increased behind him, he was unable to
hold off the pursuing pack and it was Cisneros, recovering from a poor
first beat, who took the lead at the bottom mark. Robinson remained in
second place up until the final run when Simon Payne peeled away from
the leading pair and made a huge gain to lead at the last mark, though
trying to lay the finish line under spinnaker proved to be a mistake and
Cisneros sneaked back through to win. Robinson would later be
disqualified for an incident at the start which promoted Williams to
third.

Sunday dawned windless and so overall results were to be calculated on
the two races sailed the previous day.
