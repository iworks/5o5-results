Race 1 - The City of Plymouth Trophy

The registration day and the first race day of the Edwards International
505 Class European Championships have been dominated by rain - what do
you expect in Wales in August! Race 1 was started in 5-6 knots which
steadily died during the first beat, Clive Robinson/Gary Cawthorn
rounded the windward mark, first after about 45 minutes, followed by Rob
Napier/Jonathan Rennie, Debbie Jarvis/Dan Johnson and Paul Lovesy/John
Ironmonger. It's been a long time since one of the hot favourites Ian
Pinnell/Nick Powell have been 20 minutes behind the leader at the
windward mark in a 505 race. After about 6 or 7 boats had rounded the
first mark, the wind had dropped so much that is was impossible for any
more boats to fight the tide and get round the mark, so the Race
Officer, Aubrey Allso, had no choice but to abandon the race which will
be re-sailed tomorrow at 11:00 am.

Race 1 - Second attempt

Stuart Turnbull/Jason Lunn were the pathfinders for race one, which
started promptly at 11:00 am in force 4 south westerly winds. Simon
Payne/Bill Masterman passed Ian Pinnell/Nick Powell on the first beat to
lead at the windward mark Pinnell/Powell, were second with Dave
Smithwhite/Neil Fulcher third. The leading three consolidated their
positions to finish in the same order, leaving place changes to the
chasing pack. For most competitors the greatest challenge was finding
the finishing line, as the last beat was sailed in driving rain with
only a few hundred metres visibility. With waves 4-6 feet high the
downwind sailing was superb. Race one results:-

1 GBR 8481 SIMON PAYNE/ BILL MASTERMAN
2 GBR 8736 IAN PINNELL/ NICK POWELL
3 GBR 8555 DAVID SMITHWHITE/ NEIL FULCHER
4 GER 8750 WOLFGANG HUNGER/ HOLGER JESS
5 SWE 8232 EBBE ROSEN /OLLE WENRUP
6 GBR 8556 TERRY SCUTCHER/ RICHARD TEW

Race 2 - Dunhill Trophy

The second race was started in a force 2 winds, pathfinder was Charles
Walters/Christian Diebitsch who helped by a very substantial wind shift
on the first beat, they arrived at the windward mark second, just behind
Hector Cisneros/Lawrence Crispin. Third at the first mark was the senior
team from Stone SC of Terry Selfe/Alan Montague. The wind shift had
changed the first reach to a run and many of the leading group went off
in the wrong direction. First at the gybe mark was Dave Smithwhite/Neil
Fulcher, Cisneros/Crispin had dropped to about 5th and Walters/Diebitsch
dropped to 12th. The final beat turned into a lottery as the wind filled
in from the west. Marcus Mechlbauer/Angela Stenger came from the middle
of the fleet to win from Smithwhite/Fulcher and Wolfgang Hunger/Holger
Jess who also staged a great recovery on the final leg.

1 GER 8751 MARCUS MECHLBAUER/ ANGELA STENGER
2 GBR 8555 DAVID SMITHWHITE/ NEIL FULCHER
3 GER 8750 WOLFGANG HUNGER/ HOLGER JESS
4 GBR 8458 JACK HAYHURST/ ADRIAN COATES
5 GBR 8429 ROB NAPIER/ JONATHAN RENNIE
6 GBR 8679 HECTOR CISNEROS/ LAWRENCE CRISPIN

Race 3 - The Steve Nicholson Trophy

Tuesday morning started bright, but fears of a drought, arising from
several hours without any rain, were soon averted as the rain bearing
clouds drove in and brought more trying conditions for the Race Officer,
Aubrey Allso. No sooner had the fleet departed for the race area, when
a torrential downpour reduced visibility to a few metres and killed the
wind. As the rain cleared, the wind re-built reaching 30 knots for
a short period of time, and with the rain soon returning Aubrey had to
send the fleet ashore.

The race team remained afloat and the race was started in a sunny 20
knots, building to 25 knots during the first leg, positions at the first
mark were Simon Payne/Bill Masterman, Wolfgang Hunger/Holger Jess, Dave
Smithwhite/Neil Fulcher, Debbie Jarvis/Dan Johnson. Ian Pinnell/Nick
Powell rounded 7th, but worked through the boats ahead by being the
first to set the spinnaker on the second reach, climbing to third at the
second windward mark, and then took the lead on the run, soon after the
head of the Jib failed on Payne/Masterman's boat. Mike Holmes/Paul Young
worked up to 5th at the start of the run, but lost all their gain with
a capsize. At the finish Pinnell/Powell lead by 500 metres from
Smithwhite/Fulcher and Hunger/Jess who had a close fight for second,
with the British team finishing ahead of the Germans, Payne/Masterman
completed the course in 9th place with the jib at half mast, effectively
ending their challenge for the Championships.

The waves were 4-6 feet high again, giving more superb downwind sailing.

1 GER 8736 IAN PINNELL/ NICK POWELL
2 GBR 8555 DAVID SMITHWHITE/ NEIL FULCHER
3 GER 8750 WOLFGANG HUNGER/ HOLGER JESS
4 SWE 8232 EBBE ROSEN/ OLLE WENRUP
5 GER 8746 STEFAN BOHM/ GERALD ROOS
6 GBR 8432 DEBBIE JARVIS/ DAN JOHNSON

Race 4 - The Race of the Year Trophy

The rain has finally departed Abersoch, and Race 4 was started in sunny
force 4-5, with the Swedish team of Jakob Lindvall/Kalle Byrenius acting
as the pathfinder for the day. The Race of the Year has an extra round,
which makes the total distance sailed in excess of 23 nautical miles.

On the first beat Simon Payne/Bill Masterman started early and went hard
left with very good boat speed, Richard Lord/Simon Lake started in
middle then went left, Ian Pinnell/Nick Powell started after 4 minutes
and went hard right to the shore, the left side seemed to pay and the
positions at first mark were Payne/Masterman, Pinnell/Powell, Lord/Lake
and Mike Holmes/Paul Young. Pinnell/Powell caught Payne/Masterman all
the way down the reaches and rounded the leeward mark a couple of boat
lengths ahead.

Overnight leaders Dave Smithwhite/Neil Fulcher missed the gate start by
30 seconds, and were in the late teens at the windward mark, by the
leeward mark they had pulled through to 10th, and continued their charge
during the next couple of rounds and pulled through to 5th at the end of
the second triangle. On the penultimate beat went left and were 3rd at
the start of the final run, a position they held to the finish.

By the last beat the wind had increased to force 5-6 and Payne/Masterman
tried to attack Pinnell/Powell and a number of tacks ensued, but
Pinnell/Payne maintained their position to take the winning gun.

The waves started at 4-6 feet high, and built as the wind increased to
6-8 feet, giving some of the best downwind sailing for a very, very long
time.

1 GBR 8736 IAN PINNELL/ NICK POWELL
2 GBR 8481 SIMON PAYNE/ BILL MASTERMAN
3 GBR 8555 DAVID SMITHWHITE/ NEIL FULCHER
4 GER 8746 STEFAN BOHM/ GERALD ROOS
5 GBR 8679 HECTOR CISNEROS/ LAWRENCE CRISPIN
6 GER 8750 WOLFGANG HUNGER/ HOLGER JESS

Race 5 - The Breitling Trophy

Race 5 of the 505 European Championships, sponsored by Edwards Project
Management, got underway in almost identical conditions to yesterday,
sunny, south westerly force 4-5. Today it was the turn of another
Swedish team, Ebbe Rosen/Olle Wenrup to act as the pathfinder for the
day.

On the first beat Simon Payne/Bill Masterman started after about one
minute and went hard left with very good boat speed, Mike Holmes/Paul
Young and Ian Pinnell/Nick Powell came from the middle of the start with
Holmes/Young going left and Pinnell/Powell forced by them to tack off to
the right.

At the first windward mark Holmes/Young led by a few lengths from Payne,
followed by Dave Smithwhite/Neil Fulcher, Rosen/Wenrup, Hector
Cisneros/Lawrence Crispin and Pinnell/Powell in sixth, Holmes/Young
extended their lead on the first reach but were caught again at the
gybe, Pinnell/Powell moved to up to 5th by the gybe and 4th by the
leeward mark. On the second beat Pinnell/Powell quickly powered his way
through to second, behind Payne/Masterman.

On the last beat Smithwhite/Fulcher passed Holmes/Young and
Cisneros/Crispin to take third and keep their hopes of winning the event
alive.

The stage is now set for exciting final day with Pinnell/Powell
favourite, but both Payne/Masterman and Smithwhite/Fulcher could still
win the event with a victory in race 6.

The waves were again 4-6 feet high again giving even more superb
downwind sailing.

1 GBR 8481 SIMON PAYNE/ BILL MASTERMAN
2 GBR 8736 IAN PINNELL/ NICK POWELL
3 GBR 8555 DAVID SMITHWHITE/ NEIL FULCHER
4 GBR 8679 HECTOR CISNEROS/ LAWRENCE CRISPIN
5 SWE 8232 EBBE ROSEN/ OLLE WENRUP
6 GBR 8752 MIKE HOLMES/ PAUL YOUNG

Race 6 - The Yachts & Yachting Trophy

Light and variable winds frustrated Race Officer Aubrey Allso in his
attempts to get away Race 6, for the Yachts & Yachting Trophy. One start
sequence was postponed about 2 minutes before the start and eventually
racing had to be abandoned. As is often the case the wind was at its
best for the sail home, but dropped again soon after the fleet arrived
at the beach.

The overnight leaders Ian Pinnell and Nick Powell take the European
Championships from the defending champion Bill Masterman, who was placed
third overall with his new helmsman Simon Payne.

Ian and Nick also retain their British National Title won at Hayling
Island last year. Second place was taken by Dave Smithwhite & Neil
Fulcher who sailed a very consistent series, never finishing outside the
top three. The leading Germans, Wolfgang Hunger and Holger Jess, were
the highest placed non British team in fourth place.

Overall after five races with one discard

1 GBR 8736 IAN PINNELL/ NICK POWELL 6.0
2 GBR 8555 DAVID SMITHWHITE/ NEIL FULCHER 17.4
