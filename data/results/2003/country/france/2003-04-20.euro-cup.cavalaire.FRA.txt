2003 Europa CUP Cavalaire

59 teams joined in to race the 2003 Europa CUP Cavalaire tour; 32
Germans, 21 Frenchs, 3 Swiss, 2 Danes, 1 Belgium and 1 UK teams.
KELLNER/STAMMER won convincingly over a very talented fleet - The Gorge
brothers finished second and the French team formed by Philippe Boite
and Fabrice Toupet finished third for the second year in a row. More
importantly is the fact that racing was great in medium conditions and
a special effort was put in by everyone to level up the organisation on
the water as well as on the beach taking into account all the remarks
which were brought up to our attention a year ago. Thanks to the club
and the race committee for their dedication.

Cavalaire remains the best regatta of the Euro tour in terms of number
of teams and given the quality of the race held this year, there is
a fair chance that the attendance will improve next year. Thanks to all
the teams who made it to Cavalaire and contribute to make it a great
regatta and "Rendez Vous" in Cavalaire in 2004.
