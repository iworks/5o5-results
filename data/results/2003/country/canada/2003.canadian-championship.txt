Amthors Win 2003 Canadian Championship
Boyd/tenHove Second

The Amthor brothers from Virginia, USA walked away with all the glory at
the Canadian 505 Champs this past weekend in Kingston, Ontario Canada.
Henry and Doug, sailed 4 races with a string of bullets, thus enabling
them to pack for home before the rest of the fleet finished race 5. Two
Kingston boats finished second and third, that being Boyd/ten Hove and
Fowler/Fowler. 19 505's were represented in the fleet with 12 Canadians,
3 US East Coast, and 4 Mid West US 505's making the trip to Kingston.

Although the weather did not play into race organizer Jeff Boyd's plans,
the local beer store did a booming business on Saturday. Sunday's winds
were light with two races followed by a hockey (ice) game to cool off
with. On Monday, 3 races were sailed in 5 - 10 knots of breeze in the
fresh water of Kingston.

Notable learning of the weekend: make sure your dolly fits your boat
while traveling. Seiple/Schaefer can now provide more insight on how to
properly fit a new carbon hull into rigid dolly trailer combination.

Thanks to all for making the journey to Kingston.
