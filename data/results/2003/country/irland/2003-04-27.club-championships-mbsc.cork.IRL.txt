The inaugural MBSC Spring League got underway last Saturday 29th of March in efficient fashion. The format of the league is a twelve race series held over four Saturdays, with standard MBSC Sailing Instructions to apply.

Alan Fleury in consultation with the sailors resolved to place the emphasis for the league on shorter, quicker races than the norm. This will give everyone a better chance at getting a good result while at the same time making the races closer thus improving everyone’s boat handling and knowledge of the rules.

The O.O.D. team got racing underway promptly with eight five ohs of the ten that were on the Sandquay lining up for the start (Mark Collins in Rubber Dollies was a casualty but we hope he will make it next week. James O’ Brien & Steve Cooper’s rigging problems forced them to miss the start.).

Leading round the windward mark, just ahead of the pack was Ronan Kenneally & John O’ Gorman, with Mike O’ Brien & Kieran O’ Leary and Ewen Barry & Martin Almond close behind. Positions remained in that order until the last triangle when O’ Brien & O’ Leary overtook Kenneally & O’ Gorman to take the line with Barry & Almond taking third. Wade Cuppage and Davy O’ Connell took fourth with Brian Jones & Dale Spoonley in fifth. Colin Barry & Michael McDonnell made it home after repairing their jib halyard and Gary Frost & Ken O’ Neill brought up the rear.

Race 2 got underway with Barry and Almond’s aggressive starting tactics causing problems for the pair and resulting in Alan Fleury having to hoist code flag X (or something similar) to signal an individual recall. Barry & Almond recovered well though to take third, close on the heels of Kenneally & O’ Gorman. O’ Brien & O’ Leary proved unstoppable again though to romp home in pole position. Elsewhere in the fleet Chris Marwood & Stan Reynolds took fifth to relegate Jones/Spoonley to sixth. With the finish of the second race, sleeping giants, new pairing, Barry & McDonnell had yet to make an impression on their first outing together and the fleet can only await their wrath.

Race 3 saw lighter conditions and the O.O.D team duly shortened the course. IN this race Kenneally & O’ Gorman led from start to finish with Marwood & Reynolds coming in second. A consistent third from Barry & Almond saw them hold O’ Brien & O’ Leary to fourth with Barry & McDonnell taking fifth from O’ Brien & Cooper. Gary Frost & Ken O Neill struggled to get going this week, but with three discards to apply to this league, may be able to shake off some of those results over the next three weeks, as may anyone else who missed this weeks racing.

The league now stands as follows after three races:

Ronan Kenneally / John O'Gorman 7973
Michael O'Brien / Kieran O'Leary  8752
Ewen Barry / Martin Almond 8309
Chris Marwood / Stan Reynolds 8072
Wade Cuppage / Davy O'Connell 848
Brian Jones / Dale Spoonley 7995

Week 2 of the MBSC Spring 505 league was met again with glorious sunshine and a light breeze. 8 five ohs took to the water, George Radley & Gerard Sheehan adding a new pairing to the line-up. Peter and Rose Kelly set the course as detailed above, with the start at the club line.

Race 1 got underway shortly after 14:00, with James O'Brien & Steven Cooper setting the early pace off the line. However, it was Mike O'Brien & Jackie O'Brien who led at the first mark, from Radley & Sheehan, the latter being forced to retire later in the leg with rudder problems. This allowed Ronan Kenneally & John O'Gorman to take second which they duly converted to a first at the gybe. In the absence of Michael McDonnell, Colin Barry craftily resorted to recruiting top class wire-man Andrew Moynihan to occupy the business area of 8269. The fleet immediately felt the injection of pace Moynihan inevitably brought as Barry & Moynihan quickly relegated O'Brien & O'Brien to 3rd while pressurising Kenneally & O'Gorman with impressive speed. Despite this, the leaders held on to take pole from Barry & Moynihan, with O'Brien & O'Brien coming in third from Gary Frost & Eoin White.

Race 2 started as had the first with some questionable rules situations going uncontended. Barry & Moynihan led at the first mark followed by Kenneally & O'Gorman and O'Brien & O'Brien. After taking Barry & Moynihan, Kenneally & O'Gorman held first to take honours with O'Brien & O'Brien coming in third. Frost & White maintained their scoring with another fourth.

Race 3 saw the committee having to deal with some wandering marks but the race subsequently got underway. This time it was Barry & Moynihan who held off Kenneally & O'Gorman in impressive style as a trapezing Andrew Moynihan's sublime profile dominated the view of the boats behind. A rules incident at the gybe forced Kenneally & O'Gorman to concede a 720 degree turn and with Radley & Sheehan closing up behind, they almost lost their third place. The duo held on though to take second from Radley & Sheehan who came in ahead of O'Brien & Cooper.

After two weeks sailed and two remaining, the positions are as follows

1:            Ronan Kenneally & John O'Gorman
2:            Michael O'Brien & Kieran O'Leary
3:            Colin Barry & Michael McDonnell
4:            James O'Brien & Steve Cooper
5:            Gary Frost & Ken O'Neill
6:            Ewen Barry & Martin Almond
7:            Wade Cuppage & David O'Connell
8:            Chris Marwood & Stan Reynolds
9:            Brian Jones & Dale Spoonley
10:          George Radley & Gerard Sheehan

Saturday’s racing was dominated by Charles Dwyer & Andrew Moynihan sailing James O’Brien’s 8694. Three straight firsts saw the duo hold off the challenges of Gary Frost & Ken O’Neill in race 1 and Colm Kileen & Kieran O’Leary in races 2 and 3.

Brian Jones & Dale Spoonley recovered from a sixth in race 1 to take third place in the remaining two races.

The day’s results mean that Mike O’Brien & Kieran O’Leary move into first place overall, relegating Ronan Kenneally & John O’Gorman to second. The three wins take James O’Brien & Steven Cooper into third place ahead of Colin Barry & Michael McDonnell and Gary Frost & Ken O’Neill move into fifth.

A 20kt plus south easterly was not enough to deter 6 hardy five oh crews from taking to the water on Saturday, the last day of the 505 Spring League 2003. Seasoned Race Officer Johnny Moynihan set a three round course that took in views of most of the bay and which took the sailors into the teeth of a breeze to ensure a testing conclusion to the league.

On the racing front, it was down to the wire between Mike O’Brien & Kieran O’Leary and Ronan Kenneally & John O’Gorman, with O’Brien & O’Leary seeking to hold onto first place to take the Bosun Trophy. O’Brien & O’Leary were unable to make the final day’s racing so the duo duly entrusted their Rondar 8316 to Charles Dwyer and Andrew Moynihan, the pair fancying their chances of holding off Kenneally & O’Gorman as the four prepared to race for the league. The psychological game had begun much earlier in the week with Moynihan declaring that Dwyer & Moynihan would “whup” Kenneally & O’Gorman. Kenneally & O’Gorman were unsure of how to respond to such crudities. The stage was therefore set for an epic battle for first place. The battle unfortunately did not really emerge as Dwyer & Moynihan missed the start and let Kenneally & O’Gorman take the race and the series.

The race itself was led by Kenneally & O’Gorman from the start with Brian Jones & Dale Spoonley close behind. After Kenneally & O’Gorman capsized Jones & Spoonley glided into the lead until the increasing breeze knocked the pair into the bay.  This allowed Chris Marwood & Stan Reynolds take second place, which if maintained, would see them take fifth overall in the league. Third place was going to be wrapped up by James O’Brien & Steve Cooper provided they raced and finished respectably. In Cooper’s absence, Brendan O’Reilly crewed Kyrwood 8694 and the pair gelled to produce a fourth and secure third overall. Colin Barry & Michael McDonnell had a discard to spare and were able to take fourth without sailing. Fifth was going down to the wire between Brian Jones & Dale Spoonley and Chris Marwood & Stan Reynolds. A second capsize by Jones & Spoonley ended their chances of finishing ahead of Marwood & Reynolds, the latter finishing in second but not without sustaining some rig damage. A sheared shroud fitting forced the pair to limp home after the race. A number of capsizes forced Gary Frost & Ken O’Neill to retire but the pair still took seventh overall.

Vice-Commodore and Wine Buff representative Michael McDonnell officiated at the prize giving which saw Kenneally & O’Gorman presented with the Bosun Trophy kindly donated by restaurant industry magnate Andrew Moynihan. James O’Brien & Steve Cooper and Mike O’Brien & Kieran O’Leary each took home a bottle of wine courtesy of the Wine Buff store on 4 Washington Street West, Cork.

Overall positions were as follows:

Ronan Kenneally / John O’Gorman
Michael O’Brien / Kieran O’Leary
James O’Brien / Steve Cooper
Colin Barry / Michael McDonnell
Chris Marwood / Stan Reynolds
Brian Jones / Dale Spoonley
Gary Frost / Ken O’Neill
Ewen Barry / Martin Almond
Wade Cuppage / David O’Connell
Mark Collins / John Ryan

505 Club Championships 2003
MBSC  26th – 27th April

 

Race Officers: Colm Kileen, Alan Fleury

Rescue:             Jack O’Keefe, Steve Dinan, Billy O’Brien, Judy O’Brien, Barry O’Brien,  James O’ Brien Jr., Lisa O’Brien,                           Sandy Rimmington, Andrew Welland, Colin Johns.

Course            Triangle, Sausage, Triangle

Wind:              South – South Westerly Force 4 - 5

Tide:               Flooding until 14:22 Sat and 15:18 Sun

A gusty south-westerly whipped across Monkstown Bay on Saturday followed by an even gustier southerly on Sunday to ensure the MBSC 505 Club Championships would be a heavy air contest. Saturday’s first gun was at approximately 10:25 and a Triangle, Sausage, Triangle course was set by Principal Race Officer Colm Kileen.

Race 1:

Ronan Kenneally & Charles Dwyer led around the first mark from James O’Brien & Stanley Browne and Ewen Barry & Martin Almond. Dwyer & Kenneally hoisted the colours only to be forced to douse it as the leg was too tight to carry the third sail. Meanwhile O’Brien & Browne and Barry & Almond left their kites below deck and shot past the hapless Kenneally & Dwyer to do battle for the lead which was claimed by O’Brien & Browne. Kenneally & Dwyer overtook Barry & Almond and O’Brien & Browne’s rudder problems promoted Kenneally & Dwyer to first. Barry & Almond were not to be denied however as they again relegated Kenneally & Dwyer to second. Chris Marwood & Stan Reynolds were in third and they duly took second at the next leeward rounding. An error of judgement brought Marwood and Reynolds into contact with the windward mark to force the pair into a 360 degree turn. Barry & Almond took the lead and Kenneally & Dwyer snatched second. The positions remained in that order at the finish line.

Race 2:

Barry & Almond led around the first triangle, but a capsize caused by a severe gust caught Barry napping and the pair ended up in the drink. This promoted Kenneally & Dwyer to first and Colin Barry & Andrew Moynihan to second. Despite the best efforts of Barry & Moynihan, they could not overtake the leaders and the positions remained in that order at the finish. Ewen Barry & Martin Almond recovered well to take third from Mike O’Brien & Kieran O’Leary.

Saturday evening kicked off with an Aussie style barbeque organised by the Social Committee. The evening wandered into the night with entertainment being provided by vodka and red bull fuelled Andrew Moynihan dancing to his favourite Michael Jackson tunes.

Sunday morning was calm and MBSC’s five oh fleet tuned their boats for the light air duelling that was in store. A shift to the south saw the breeze increase to a force 4 which remained for the day, forcing the boats to be readjusted in a hurry.

Race 3:

Barry & Almond pulled off a lucky port end start and the pair led for much of the beat to Raffeen. Kenneally & Dwyer were able to snatch first however and the boats rounded the windward mark with Barry & Almond in second, followed by O’Brien & O’Leary. Colin Barry & Michael McDonnell in fourth were looking dangerous but several capsizes later and the gallery were wondering if the pair were racing for the club championships or trawling for mackerel. The positions stood as above at the finish. After this race Chris Marwood & Stan Reynolds did some serious mast damage and were forced to limp home assisted by the rescue boat.

Race 4:

Kenneally & Dwyer again led from midway up the first beat, as Barry & Almond pulled off some arrogant starting manoeuvres as if to taunt the fleet into overtaking them. O’Brien & O’Leary eventually overtook Barry & Almond but some nice downwind sailing by Barry & Almond reversed the positions yet again. Barry & Almond however could not hold on, and O’Brien & O’Leary recovered to take second. The finish to this race saw a surprising addition to the top three places as James O’Brien & Dion Barrett decided they wanted to get involved in the racing. O’Brien & Barrett took third from Barry & McDonnell who were in fourth.

Race 5:

Kenneally & Dwyer led this race from start to finish with James O’Brien & Dion     Barrett in hot pursuit ahead of O’Brien & O’Leary. Kenneally & Dwyer attempted to give the rest of the fleet a chance to catch up by doing an extra leg but the opportunity was missed by the chasing pack and Kenneally & Dwyer held on to      take a close first from O’Brien & Barrett.

Race 6:

A close race saw Mike O’Brien & Kieran O’Leary come out ahead of James  O’Brien & Dion Barrett. Ewen Barry & Martin Almond were also involved but only managed a third place.

 

Overall the event finished as follows:

      1)      Ronan Kenneally / Charles Dwyer

2)      Michael O'Brien / Kieran O'Leary

3)      Ewen Barry / Martin Almond

4)      James O'Brien / Stanley Browne

5)      Colin Barry / Michael M’Donnell

6)      Brian Jones / Dale Spoonley

7)      Chris Marwood / Stan Reynolds

8)      Wade Cuppage / Jennifer Cuppage

 


MBSC Vice-Commodore Michael McDonnell presents the Club Championship trophy to Ronan Kenneally and Charles Dwyer 

 

Ashore the sailors traded stories from the weekend’s racing with some stories illustrated by abrupt hand gesturing. Brian Jones & Dale Spoonley in the newly acquired Rondar 8408 looked quizzically what they had been sailing and wondered where it had all gone wrong. The pair were disappointed with their showing overall and pontificated that they may do better if the club moved to a bigger bay where they would not have to turn so often. 

The prize-giving was held in a packed club house where the weekend was brought to a pleasant close. Commodore Kieran O’Leary presented the Club Championships Perpetual Trophy and bottles of wine to the winners courtesy of Michael McDonnell of the Wine Buff Store on Washington Street West.
