505s at Sandusky, OH
September 11-12
By Graham Alexander

Well a large number of the Midwest 505ers were there. Hoover had 100%
participation. Basically all 505s in the Midwest that have traveled in
the last year made it to Sandusky. The wind and temperatures were more
like summer than fall, but the RC got in three races Saturday and two
Sunday as planned.

It should have been declared a four-way tie since the first four boats
were 13, 14, 14, and 15 for total scores. In just one of many instances,
any one in the front group could have won. For example, just before Ki
crossed the finish in the third race he jibed and a spin sheet went
under the boat and he lost a place. If that had not happened, and Ki had
not lost that one boat, it would have been a four-way tie for first.
Similarly the middle of the fleet finished with 29, 30, 31. I have never
seen such close racing for a whole weekend. Everyone was trying to catch
the boat which was just ahead but also looking back to make sure they
didnít lose the one just behind.

We would also like to thank our guest rock star, Ali Meller for coming
to the regatta. He was an immense help getting everyone tuned up. Other
than the North American Championship in Detroit [in 1993], that is the
first time in more than 25 years that anyone from out of the region has
come to the Midwest. {We count Ontario boats as defacto Midwest boats.
They regularly come to Windsor and Sandusky}. The North American
Championships in Waukegan was about 25 years ago and a qualifier for
Worlds and we even had west coast boats come.

As Stephenís email of last Thursday indicated, there is a regatta in
Chicago this coming weekend, and then most of the fleet has decided to
go to Bloomington in three weeks. Hope to see you all at least one more
time before winter starts.

Sincerely,

Graham Alexander
