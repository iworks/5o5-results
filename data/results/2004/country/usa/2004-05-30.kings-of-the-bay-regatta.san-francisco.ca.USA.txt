2004 - Kings of the Bay Regatta

A very competitive fleet of 14 boats enjoyed nearly perfect conditions
at this weekend's 505 Kings of the Bay Regatta hosted by the Treasure
Island Sailing Center. Racing took place off the northern end of
Treasure Island in picture perfect weather with 12-20 mph winds. Mike
Martin/Jeff Nelson showed good speed and tactical smarts to sieze the
crowns (to be purchased at Burger King later today....) from runner's up
Andy Beeckman/Ben Benjamin and third place finishers Bruce Edwards/Dave
Shelton. Great to see a few new fleet members participating including
Ryan Nelson/Brett Tracy, Jennifer Lawson/Soren Jensen, and Team Pegasus.

Special thanks to the following for helping out with race committee and
regatta logistics: Matt Jones, Dave Guinther, Jane Guinther, Dave Byron,
Rob Gewecke, Patrick Weaver, Jay Auslander, and Douglas Hagan.

Dave Guinther took some great digital pics on Saturday and I have a roll
of film from Rob Gewecke with pics from Sat. and Sun. that I plan on
getting developed and bringing to Santa Cruz. Thumbnails of the Guinther
pics can be downloaded from: http://www.tisailing.org/505/KOTB04/.

I will work with Dave to get full sized copies of the thumbnails for you
if you are interested in any of the photos and will try and bring a cd
 of Rob's pics to SCYC next weekend.

I probably picked a bad weekend to host this event so the turnout was
less than it could have been. Hopefully we will see more of you next
year! Things you can count on when you come to this event:

Guaranteed Wind!
- A single class event run by a professional PRO
- A challenging tactical venue that includes shifts, velocity, and
 current
- World's type racing format (gate starts, worlds courses)
- Beer and BBQ on Sat. and Sun. included in entry fee
- A quick reach to the race course and back to TISC

Thanks again to everyone who participated and/or helped out! See you all
next weekend (June 5-6) in Santa Cruz!

Sail Fast,
-Nick
