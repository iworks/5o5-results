Danish Nationals

Here are the results from the Danish Nationals in Hornbaek - North
Zealand; 15 boats from SWE, DEN, GER; Excellent competition.

After six races in burning sun, heavy rain and thunderstorm, wind in all
speeds and from all directions, the same with the current!!

Races where managed excellent by race commite, no waiting between races,
good courses, good food, good beer, nice club, can´t complain about
anything except the fact that I didn't win the nationals.

Cheers
