1999 505 Hyannis Annual, Hyannis, MA
July 30 - August 1

The Hyannis Annual was a great event for this year. We had six well run
races with minimum down time between heats. The courses in particular
were set very well with nice, tight reaches. Winds ranged from 10 to 18
kts with low to moderate chop, plenty of current, moderate temps, and
blazing sunshine.

Neal & Cathy's hospitality was huge; they put up over half the fleet
including everyone from the mid atlantic area. Many thanks.

Now, how about some lame excuses?

Ali Meller - afraid of being beaten by the Amthors [Ed/Ali, this happens so often I've gotten over my fear of it]

Rene De La Rie - elected not to come when he found out the piano bar was booked up every night

Allan Freedman - spent 2 weeks in obedience school overseas; now suffers from "yes dear" syndrome

Jesse Falsone - trapped at home - has not yet figured out that he can use this event to celebrate his wedding anniversary.

Tom Price - is waiting for the 505 fleet to hold an event on the magothy river

Macy Nelson - Hyannis makes his back hurt - and Dr. Terry was not around to administer a drug cocktail...

Tim Collins - found the naked flag bearer job position at the HYC was taken, so he assumed his services were not required

Bill Smith - preoccupied with finishing his undergraduate education. Also afraid of being beaten by the Amthors.

Lauren Abramson - elected to rebuild boat at the beginning of the 1999 season, project scheduled for completion mid 2001

Peter Alarie - disgusted with inept drivers - traded his skipper in for one extra hull

Tyler Moore - traded his 505 for a tugboat
