1999 West Coast Midwinters
Alamitos Bay YC
February 13-14

We had a light turnout for the 1999 southern California mid-winters
mainly because none of the Northern California flakes showed up. It was
their loss though. We had perfect conditions; sunny, warm and variety of
wind strengths.

The racing in the harbour on Saturday was in light wind until the latter
part of the third race when the breeze picked up for the run home.
Sunday started much the same, around noon. After the first race however,
the wind picked up to ~15 knots from the S SW and we were able to get
two more good races in, rounding out the weekend with a total of six.

The racing was good with the lead changing in almost every race. Mike
and Howard gave their new Waterat a good christening by winning the
first and second race. In the next two races Andy Zinn and Danny
Thompson came on strong to win and take the lead. For the last two races
the wind kicked in and Mike and Howard were able to use their downwind
speed to win the races and take the regatta.

After sailing Danny Thompson was explaining his theory that the Northern
California Boats don't like to come down because they are afraid that
all of the Southern California boats will beat them. Furthermore, he
challenges any Northern California boat to come to the Hi-Per regatta,
April 10,11 and is willing to bet free beer to any Northern California
boat that can beat any Southern California boat.
