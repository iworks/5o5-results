South Bay Regatta

And I thought Corpus Cristi was a great place to hold a 5o5 regatta!

Well, Redwood city is all that and more! Women, Yes(Dutch Goose!!!)
Breeze, Yes (this weekend 18-30knts), water temp 65f, air temp mid 70s,
medium chop, excellent facility, and beautiful No. cal scenery to top it
all off.

Sat. started off uneventful, yet that is not the word to sum up the day.
Basically every thing was cool, and then we found ourselves in 3-4 foot
(chop?) and a steady 30 kt breeze. Have you ever heard the expression
"Breeze On"? But if you weren't their, don't worry you didn't miss
anything.

After all, 5o5s aren't very much fun reaching in 25-30kt breeze. Sunday
mellowed out with a steady 18-25kt. howl, and we were able to finish off
the regatta with 6 very memerable races. I would like to Salute Steve
Bourdow and his staff for hosting and really fun regatta. I hope that
the 5o5 class will incorporate Redwood city into our circuit, as it is
truly a great spot for us.

P.S. please keep a close eye on the schedule, as things are constantly
being Added and Updated.

Thanks 4 com' in!
