Grafham Water Sailing Club 21st/22nd April

505 Inlands


On the weekend of 22/23 April, Grafham Water SC hosted the 505 Inland
Championships with a strong home fleet and 3 entry from France.

Light and fickle winds saw Saturday’s racing postponed, so 4 races were
scheduled for Sunday in 15 gusting 20 knots, perfect sailing conditions.

Philippe Boite, the French 505 legend, won the opening race from Simon
Payne and Bill Masterman, sailing their new boat, with Pinnell third.

The second race went to Payne with Dave Smithwaite and Neil Fulcher
second and Boite in third while Pinnell slipped to fifth.

In the third race Pinnell and Hunt made no mistake winning from Boite,
Payne retiring with gear problems.

With everything to go for in the final race for the four leaders it was
Payne first round the windward mark with Pinnell down in fourth but
quickly up into third and then through on the shifts to a comfortable
lead and the title. The order of the final race being the final overall
positions with Payne and Masterman second and Boite third.
