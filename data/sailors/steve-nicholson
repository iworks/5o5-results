Steve Nicholson
26 January 2000

Steve passed away last night from an asthma attack at Ian Pinnell's house, he
was in his early 30's.

He was the shop manager at Pinnell & Bax and was well known in UK and European
sailing circles, being a regular 505 (GBR8707), Fireball and Enterprise helm.

Those who attended the last 505 worlds in Quiberon will remember Steve as
a part of team OVL.

He will be much missed on the UK and European circuits.

We are very sorry about that. We do. We are in Hongkong and had learnt Mr Steve Nicholson's achievement in sailing.

I am shocked to read of Steve's untimely death and the tragic circumstance.
I met Steve at Quiberon and later where he worked.

He went out of his way to assist me in re-rigging my boat and taking an
interest in improving our performance. He expressed very keen interest in
participating in Durban this coming November and doubtless his keeness would
have been greatly appreciated.

It is a very sad day - enthusiasm is a precious quality and he had plenty of
it. Please pass my condolences to his near and loved ones.

Hello Simon,

I don't know if you remember me, but we met at St. Petersburg last year.
I want to offer you my sincere condolences. I'm sure he was a great guy, since
I haven't met a 505 sailor who wasn't.

I have asthma myself, so I know what he must have gone through. At least he
passed away among friends.

Simon,

I was extremely sad to hear of Steve's premature death. From me personally
I would appreciate it if you could pass on my condolences to Steve's family
and colleagues. As one of the Queen Mary Sailing Club teams competing at
Quiberon with Steve and Jon Mildred, I think that Simon Sydenham, Matthew
Brittin, Chris Pearson, Patrick McGale and Mike Nolan would all also
appreciate it if their condolences could be passed on as well.

Finally, in this message, on behalf of Queen Mary Sailing Club, as Commodore
of the Club, I would appreciate it if Steve's family and colleagues could be
informed that condolences come from the Club also.

In sorrow,
Frank Rainsborough

Dear Ian,

I read Simon's e-mail to the 505world list just moments ago. I am still in
shock. My condolences to Steve's friends and family. I wish I could think of
better words to write......
