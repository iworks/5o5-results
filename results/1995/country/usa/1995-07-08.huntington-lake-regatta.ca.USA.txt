Huntington Lake Regatta, July 8-9

by Mike Martin

17 boats

As usual the weather was beautiful for this regatta. However instead of
blowing down the lake as it normally does, the wind was from the south
blowing across the lake. This caused the most erratic wind conditions
ever seen. Boats three boatlengths apart would have wind in opposite
directions, and 20 knot puffs followed instantly by 0 Knot lulls. This
lead to some exciting racing with the lead changing on almost every leg
of every race. The first race was won by new boat owners Jay & Jackey
Golison, who apparently used up all their luck in the first race since
they ripped their chute in the second race and tipped over in the third.
Howard and Mike happened to be the lead boat at the finish of the last
two races to take the regatta by only 1/2 point over Bruce and Chris.
Bruce and Chris made the fatal mistake of leading the pack at the first
mark of every race, thus setting up themselves to be passed as the pack
would ride past them in random gusts as they sat helplessly in no wind
on the run (if you could call it that). The royal family of Huntington
Lake, Mark and Allison finished third sailing consistently in the tricky
conditions with all top 5 finishes. Further scores are a bit confused
since Fresno Yacht Club never posted official results.
